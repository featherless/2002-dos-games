# DOS games

> A chapter of featherless' [digital creative history](https://github.com/featherless/digital-creative-history).

I've always loved video games, especially as a conduit for learning how to program computers.

In the summer between grade 9 and grade 10 I taught myself how to program in C++ by making a series
of simple DOS-based games.

## Galaxiados

When: June 14-15, 2002.

Language features I was still learning how to use:

- Else statements
- Arrays

The source code has great gems of documentation.

    Release Dates-
      v0.1(June 14, 2002):
        Includes the first level, ability to move up, down, left
        and right.
          Will add for v0.2:
        lives | instructions | more sound effects | more levels
      v0.11(June 15, 2002)
        I finally figured out how to get the asteroids to work with
        an array
      v0.12(June 15, 2002)
        I have added the pause feature, I'll make it as a function
        probably later on.
      v0.2(June 15, 2002)
        Finished level two, including a smart AI that shoots at you,*
        A little more color,cheat codes, hehe*, a new menu,
        your scores get saved in the program, but only temporary.
          Will add for v0.3:
        storyline! | more details | even more levels | save scores
      v0.21(June 15, 2002)
        I found a bug where, if you die on level two by hitting an
        asteroid, but the aliens had already shot, the shot would
        mysteriously keep going when you restarted.

## Roidian

When: June 18-19, 2002 and November 15, 2002.

    Release Dates-
      v0.1(June 18, 2002)
        Includes two levels in Arcade mode, along with a level
        editor.  Use arrow keys to move and jump, etc.
          Will add for v0.2:
        save feature with levels | more levels
      v0.11(June 18, 2002)
        Created another level for Arcade mode.
      v0.12(June 19, 2002)
        Added a demo level with the level creator, added another
        obstacle, The Block!, you can push that around, and it
        falls!  Also made the program slightly smaller and fixed a
        glitch with the level editor.
      v0.20(November 15, 2002)
        I have now added the ability to save and load your levels
        in the format *.rdl.  This is a great advance in the game,
        that's why it is now v0.20.  If you would like to add
        levels to the arcade mode, send your rdl files to me, and
        I will add them to the arcade mode.

## Arcade

When: July 2-15, 2002.

Featured a single game: Hover Pong.

    Release Dates-
      v0.10(July 2, 2002)
        There is only one game so far, Hover Pong, but I am basing
        the entire game on my calculator version of my Arcade that
        I made about 3 or 4 months ago, it will be very fun once
        finished.
          Will add for v0.20
        a LOT more games | Instructions | A better load menu
        an overall scorekeeper, with high scores
      v0.11(July 13, 2002)
        Made the entire program a little more functional, added
        the instructions and the better load menu.  Also, the
        overall scorekeeper is finished, however, I might have to
        slightly fix it...
      v0.12(July 15, 2002)
        Added a WHOLE lot more functionality, high scores menu,
        and it works too!  Also the ability to change the speed in
        Hover Pong.  Oh, and I promise I'll add more games soon!!
